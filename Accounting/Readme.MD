# Currently in (thinking about making it) stage

# Text based accounting software, similar to [ledger](https://www.ledger-cli.org/)

## What ledger isn't doing for me
* Dynamic changing of price. if I buy 10 thing for 10$ then buy 5 thing for 15$. now ledger cant tell me how much the remaining inventory costed me.

The syntax would be similar but I'll make it simpler since the accounting needed in my coutry is not very complicated
