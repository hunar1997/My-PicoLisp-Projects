# My-PicoLisp-Projects

Hello, this is a collection of all my projects/codes that are written using picolisp.. because my code was split between my home computer & my phone (termux) and the computer at work .. so i wanted to keep them in one place :)

Notes:
* Some projects might be outside this repository and are only links
* I'm mostly interested in the new version of picolisp called pil21 and almost never check backwards compatibility with the old picolisp that exists all over the intenet
* Most projects would be incomplete or under construction, but you'll be able to determine it by reading their readme :)

You may find it useful, IDK

Enjoy :D
