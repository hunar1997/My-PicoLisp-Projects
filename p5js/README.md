# Nothing here works

This was an attempt at using p5js library with pil, but didn't go anywhere since i stopped working on it due to my lack of pil skills :)

The html file is what i'm aiming for, I want to auto generate and run js functions from pil to create what a.html is creating

I might reconsider this project in the future
